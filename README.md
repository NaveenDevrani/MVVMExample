# What is MVVM? 

MVVM stands for Model View ViewModel and it is a design pattern that is used to build softwares. But here our focus is only about Android App Development. MVVM helps us to separate the Business Logic of our Application from the Views or UI. And doing this thing is very important in case of any kind of software or app development.  

Model : This is responsible for handling the data in the application. Model cannot directly interact with Views, but it interacts with ViewModels and then Views with the help of observables. (Sounds confusing right? Donâ€™t worry in the course we will cover every step in detail).    

View: This is the User Interface of our Application. It should not contain any application logic.  

ViewModel: It is basically a link between Model and View.
